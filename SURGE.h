// This is SURGE - the Simple Universal Realistic Game Engine. It does
// NOT attempt to me a hold-your-hand, do-everything-for-you engine
// like... every other engine I have ever used. All this does is
// compile the common methods I use in every game I make, so I can
// stop rewriting the same code over and over and over. YMMV, HTH.
